## Sheet 2 & 3: Advanced Filter
I built a structured table to enable dynamic filtering. It enables targeted analysis of imaging trends before key cutoff dates.
### Applied criteria from a dedicated Criteria sheet:
  - MRI scans filter December 31, 2018, and newer
  - CT scans filtered December 31, 2019, and newer
